# wiki
Repo for the Wiki Project in CS50's Web Programming course.

This project consists of a web application that resembles a Wikipedia page, letting users create and edit wiki entries in Markdown language.
The application offers some additional functionality, such as being able to search for specific entries or to be taken to a random entry.
